This is a parody of the google snake game.

This project was built using the pygame module and was heavily inspired by the Clearcode youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvqStqPCRU

The main file for the snake game is snake_main_game.py. The Logic.py file includes the initial mechanics I developed for the project without using pygame. Although it is 
by no means perfect or completed, it served as a nice blueprint to improve upon using pygame to fully flesh out the working flow of the game.
