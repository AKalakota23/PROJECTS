This is a parody of the google snake game.

This project was built using the pygame module and was heavily inspired by the Clearcode youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvqStqPCRU

The main file for the snake game is snake_main_game.py. The Logic.py file includes the initial mechanics I developed for the project without using pygame, which functions as a game by itself, but it was mainly a nice blueprint to improve upon using pygame to fully flesh out the working flow of the game in the main file.
